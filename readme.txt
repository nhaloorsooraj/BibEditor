BibEditor is an experimental program to limit the number of authors in the given .bib file.
Motivation for the program is nothing but I found that when adding bibliography in LaTeX
simply by using \bibliography will display all the authors, and I felt it is a pain-in-ass 
to manually edit each line of authors in a .bib file.

This program will ask you for the number of authors you want to display and simply remove all other
authors and put an et.al at the tail. Simple :)

        HOW TO USE
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

1) Place your ref.bib file in the same folder.

IMPORTANT:
[ Rename it to "ref.bib" (without quotations) if your .bib file has a different name. ]

2) Run the program .

3) It will ask you for the number of maximum authors. Give what it asks! 

3) Press ENTER, and take a few deep breaths ;)

4) Your modified .bib will be generated as output.bib

5) Verify for errors.

6) If you have any questions or need assistance:
