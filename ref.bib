            Wearable dosimeters form an essential part of the personnel protection scheme in work spaces such as defence, nuclear establishments, and medical fields with radiation hazard. In the current scenario where use of high energy ionizing radiation sources (nuclear sources) is indispensable, the need of radiation detectors is mandatory for measuring the dose received by the person exposed in his work space and also measure the dose for patients where nuclear radiation is used for treatment. Wearable dosimeters need to have some special requirements apart from being accurate, precise, and robust. These need to be light in weight and should cause no harm to the human body while it is touching the body or apparels. This paper comprises an introduction to dosimeters, key characteristics, important techniques used for detection of neutrons and X‐rays and also mentions about a few potential companies involved in developing wearable dosimeters in these application areas. The techniques have been collated, described, compared and the need to detect neutrons and X‐rays has been expressed keeping in mind the demand from the defence and medical disciplines. This review also contains artificial intelligence and internet of things which form the basis of trending and upcoming wearable dosimeters.},

Robots, which are being researched and developed in Sandia National Laboratories, sometimes built as small as the size of a pollen grain, can be utilized to constantly monitor the stress analysis within all aspects of running a Nuclear Power Plant. From cooling towers to detecting miniscule cracks within pipes, MEMS can be utilized to constantly detect and even possibly repair minor faults within the overall structure of a nuclear power plant. MEMS technologies provide the ability to reliably produce micro actuators and sensors to meet these mission requirements. MEMS technologies are also attracting an increasing interest from the commercial sector for various applications. Currently, Sandia National Laboratories has been developing MEMS technologies to support its core missions of weapon surety, stockpile maintenance, and national security interests. Already, the project has been responsible for numerous electromechanical systems in nuclear weapons, which ensure nuclear safety and provide reliable arming, fusing and firing. With these factors in consideration, the main idea of this paper is to present ideas for producing sensors and robots on a micro scale, which could be programmed to communicate and work within each other to have enhanced safety and efficiency within a nuclear power plant.},

Gamma cameras and dual-particle cameras are increasingly being used for source location. This study reviews and discusses the research advancements in the field of gamma-ray and neutron measurements using mobile radiation detection systems since the Fukushima nuclear accident.

	abstract = {
Within the last few years graphene, a material
consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms, has
demonstrated exceptional electrical properties that we are
using to develop novel semiconductor-based radiation
detectors. Our prototype device is an electrically biased
graphene field effect transistor (GFET) on a
semiconductor substrate which served as radiation
absorber. The resistance of graphene changes with
induced charge in the semiconductor substrate below
graphene, which produces a local change in the electric
field near graphene. Our detection technique is sensitive
to the presence of the charge even prior to charge
collection, and thus bypasses the traditional approach
taken by current radiation detection systems. This
approach presents a few potential advantages over
traditional detectors such as faster response, lower noise,
and higher sensitivity to the electron charge without
needing to collect the associated holes. In this paper we
discuss three novel radiation detection applications of
graphene FETs.

	url = {https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1235486/FULLTEXT01.pdf},
	abstract = {This thesis presents a novel approach to integrate chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene
into silicon micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) to fabricate different
graphene based MEMS/NEMS structures and explore mechanical properties of graphene as well as
their applications such as acceleration sensing, humidity sensing and CO2 sensing. The thesis also
presents a novel method of characterization of CVD graphene grain boundary based defects.
The first section of this thesis presents a robust, scalable, flexible route to integrate double-layer
graphene membranes to a silicon substrate so that large silicon masses are suspended by graphene
membranes.
In the second section, doubly-clamped suspended graphene beams with attached silicon masses
are fabricated and used as model systems for studying the mechanical properties of graphene and
transducer elements for NEMS resonators and extremely small accelerometers, occupying die areas
that are at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the die areas occupied by the most compact
state-of-the-art silicon accelerometers. An averaged Young’s modulus of double-layer graphene of
{\textasciitilde}0.22 TPa and non-negligible built-in stresses of the order of 200-400 MPa in the suspended
graphene beams are extracted, using analytical and FEA models. In addition, fully clamped
suspended graphene membranes with attached proof masses are also realized, which are used for
acceleration sensing.
In the third section, CO2 sensing of single-layer graphene and the cross-sensitivity between CO2
and humidity are shown. The cross-sensitivity of CO2 is negligible at typical CO2 concentrations
present in air. The properties of double-layer graphene when exposed to humidity and CO2 have
been characterized, with similarly fast response and recovery behaviour but weak resistance
responses, compared to single layer graphene.
In the fourth section, a fast and simple method for large-area visualization of grain boundaries in
CVD graphene transferred to a SiO2 surface is demonstrated. The method only requires vapor
hydrofluoric acid (VHF)-etching and optical microscope inspection and therefore could be useful to
speed up the process of developing large-scale high quality graphene synthesis, and can also be
used for analysis of the influence of grain boundaries on the properties of emerging graphene
devices that utilize CVD graphene patches placed on a SiO2 substrate.

            2D layered materials have sparked great interest from the perspective of basic physics and applied science in the past few years. Extraordinarily, many novel stacked structures that bring versatile properties and applications can be artificially assembled, as exemplified by vertical van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, twisted multilayer 2D materials, hybrid dimensional structures, etc. Compared with the ordinary synthesis process, the stacking technique is a powerful strategy to achieve high‐quality and freely controlled 2D material stacked structures with atomic accuracy. This review highlights the most advanced stacking techniques involving the preparation, transfer, and stacking of high‐quality single crystal 2D materials. Apart from the 2D–2D stacked structures, 2D–0D, 2D–1D, and 2D–3D structures offer a prospective platform for the increasing application of 2D materials. The assembly strategy and physical properties of these stacked structures strongly depend on the factors in the stacking process, including the surface quality, angle control, and sample size. In addition, comparative analysis tables on the techniques involved are also available. The summary of these strategies and techniques will hopefully provide a valuable reference for relevant work.},

Solution processable graphene sheets derived from graphite can form stable dispersions in solutions and are amenable to bulk scale processing and ink jet printing. However, the electrical conductivity and carrier mobilities of this material are usually reported to be orders of magnitude poorer than that of the mechanically cleaved counterpart due to its higher density of defects, which restricts its use in electronics. Here, we show that by optimizing several key factors in processing, we are able to fabricate high mobility graphene films derived from large sized graphene oxide sheets, which paves the way for all-carbon post-CMOS electronics. All-carbon source-drain channel electronics fabricated from such films exhibit significantly improved transport characteristics, with carrier mobilities of 365 cm(2)/(V.s) for hole and 281 cm(2)/(V.s) for electron, measured in air at room temperature. In particular, intrinsic mobility as high as 5000 cm(2)/(V.s) can be obtained from such solution-processed graphene films when ionic screening is applied to nullify the Coulombic scattering by charged impurities.},

            Recent years have witnessed the rise of graphene and its applications in various electronic devices. Specifically, featuring excellent flexibility, transparency, conductivity, and mechanical robustness, graphene has emerged as a versatile material for flexible electronics. In the past decade, facilitated by various laser processing technologies, including the laser‐treatment‐induced photoreduction of graphene oxides, flexible patterning, hierarchical structuring, heteroatom doping, controllable thinning, etching, and shock of graphene, along with laser‐induced graphene on polyimide, graphene has found broad applications in a wide range of electronic devices, such as power generators, supercapacitors, optoelectronic devices, sensors, and actuators. Here, the recent advancements in the laser fabrication of graphene‐based flexible electronic devices are comprehensively summarized. The various laser fabrication technologies that have been employed for the preparation, processing, and modification of graphene and its derivatives are reviewed. A thorough overview of typical laser‐enabled flexible electronic devices that are based on various graphene sources is presented. With the rapid progress that has been made in the research on graphene preparation methodologies and laser micronanofabrication technologies, graphene‐based electronics may soon undergo fast development.},

The G-FETs were driven by a reference-gate operating in buffer solution, and exhibited very good transport characteristics. The G-FETs detected the pH value of the solution with high precision. The Dirac point shifted in the positive direction with increasing pH of the solution. The detection limit (signal/noise=3) for measuring changes in the pH of the solution was estimated to be 0.025, indicating the high sensitivity of the G-FETs. Moreover, the devices electrically detected proteins with different charge types. The drain current decreased (increased) when positively (negatively) charged proteins were added to the solution. These results indicate that the G-FETs are among the most suitable candidates for FET-based chemical and biological sensors.},

We designed the layout of the sensors with the help of Sentaurs TCAD. We simulated static operations and the dynamic response to radiation and calculated the source–drain current through the graphene layer with a quasi-analytical model. The transistors were produced at the National Enterprise for nanoScience and nanoTechnology by depositing high quality graphene on silicon chips manufactured by the Fondazione Bruno Kessler foundry. To reduce the high contact resistance between graphene and aluminum contacts caused by oxidation of the aluminum surface, we used gold/chromium interfaces. We investigated the sensors behavior by mean of electrical measurements, extracting the graphene properties, such as mobility and doping. We observed modulation of the source–drain current, determined the Dirac point and found the optimal voltage levels to be sensitive to pulsed IR laser light and β-particles.},

Fig. 1(A) shows the construction of a field effect transistor. It consists of a piece of n-type germanium or silicon slab with a p-type junction formed around the center of the slab. Two ohmic contacts are placed in the vicinity of the junction. Three electrodes are connected to the transistor. The electrode connected to the junction is called the “gate.” The electrodes connected to the ohmic contacts are called the “source” and the “drain.” Five papers have already appeared on the field-effect transistors1‾5 in which the design theory, their experimental verification, the d-c equivalent circuit, and the estimate of the maximum cutoff frequency were presented. This paper describes an a-c equivalent circuit of the field effect transistor; the measured parameters of a type of germanium field effect transistor, and some of its circuit applications, with emphasis on oscillators and switching circuits.

	abstract = {The junction-gate field-effect transistor (JFET) is one of the simplest types of field-effect transistor. JFETs are three-terminal semiconductor devices that can be used as electronically controlled switches or resistors, or to build amplifiers. 
Unlike bipolar junction transistors, JFETs are exclusively voltage-controlled in that they do not need a biasing current. Electric charge flows through a semiconducting channel between source and drain terminals. By applying a reverse bias voltage to a gate terminal, the channel is pinched, so that the electric current is impeded or switched off completely. A JFET is usually conducting when there is zero voltage between its gate and source terminals. If a potential difference of the proper polarity is applied between its gate and source terminals, the JFET will be more resistive to current flow, which means less current would flow in the channel between the source and drain terminals.
JFETs are sometimes referred to as depletion-mode devices, as they rely on the principle of a depletion region, which is devoid of majority charge carriers. The depletion region has to be closed to enable current to flow.
JFETs can have an n-type or p-type channel. In the n-type, if the voltage applied to the gate is negative with respect to the source, the current will be reduced (similarly in the p-type, if the voltage applied to the gate is positive with respect to the source). Because a JFET in a common source or common drain configuration has a large input impedance (sometimes on the order of 1010 ohms), little current is drawn from circuits used as input to the gate.},

Among these are the tailoring of the internal gates shape to implement a non-linear signal response and provide a larger dynamic range or a drastic increase of the DePFETs amplification. Furthermore, super pixels providing capabilities to reach sub electron noise and single electron resolution through repetitive readout, a fast electronic shutter at pixel level and the realization of multiple storage regions within one pixel have been tested.

	abstract = {High-k gate dielectrics like HfO2 and HfSiO(N) are considered for the replacement of SiO2 and SiON layers in advanced complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices. Using these gate oxides allows indeed to drastically reduce the leakage current flowing through the device, as required by the specifications of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. However, major problems remain to be solved before the possible use of high-k gate dielectrics in integrated circuits. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the challenges and issues pertaining to high-k-based devices. Several issues are discussed in detail, like flat-band and threshold voltage control, carrier mobility degradation, charge trapping, gate dielectric wear-out and breakdown, and bias temperature instabilities. Our current understanding of these issues is presented, with an emphasis on the relationship between the material properties of the gate stack, and the electrical properties of the devices. The combination of metal gates with high-k gate dielectric appears to be a promising solution for the further scaling down of CMOS devices.},

MBCFETs are fabricated using 90\% or more of FinFET processes with only a few revised masks, allowing easy migration from FinFET process. Not only on-target but also multiple Vt is achieved in challengingly limited vertical spacing between channels. Also, reliability of MBCFETs is shown to be comparable to that of FinFETs. Three representative superior characteristics of MBCFET compared to FinFET have been demonstrated — better gate control with 65 mV/dec sub-threshold swing (SS) at short gate length, higher DC performance with a larger effective channel width (Weff) at reference footprint, and design flexibility with variable nanosheet (NS) widths. The optimization of the standard cell design by using variable NS width is evaluated. The usefulness of MBCFET as a multi-purpose performance provider is proven by the modulation of effective capacitance (Ceff), effective resistance (Reff) and frequency by Weff control. Finally, mass production feasibility with MBCFET is proven through a fully working high density SRAM circuit.},

The membrane has a low thermal conductivity coefficient and, therefore, thermally isolates the electronic components from the chip frame. This low thermal mass device allows the reduction of the power consumption to a value of 90 mW for an array of four MOSFETs at an operating temperature of 170/spl deg/C. Three of the MOSFETs have their gate covered with thin catalytic metals and are used as gas sensors. The fourth one has a standard gate covered with nitride and could act as a reference.

After a two-temperature trim, the proposed sensor achieves an inaccuracy of ±0.1°C (3σ) over the military temperature range: -55°C to 125°C. This represents a 5× improvement in accuracy over previously reported MOSFET-based temperature sensors. The chip was implemented in a 0.16-μm standard CMOS process.

This structure reduces electronic noise by minimising stray capacitance and enables highly efficient optical coupling between the detector back-side and scintillator, providing a fill factor of close to 100\%. The detector is specifically designed for use in high resolution gamma cameras, where a pixellated scintillator crystal is directly coupled to an array of silicon photodetectors. The on-chip JFET is matched with the photodiode capacitance and forms the input stage of an external charge sensitive preamplifier (CSA). The integrated monolithic feedback capacitor eliminates the need for an external feedback capacitor in the external electronic readout circuit, improving the system performance by eliminating uncontrolled parasitic capacitances. An optimised noise figure of 152 electrons RMS was obtained with a shaping time of 2 μs and a total detector capacitance of 2pF. The energy resolution obtained at room temperature (21 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$C) at 27 keV (direct interaction of I-125 gamma rays) was 5.09\%, measured at full width at half maximum (FWHM). The effectiveness of the guard ring in minimising the detector leakage current and its influence on the total charge collection volume is clearly demonstrated by the IBIC images.},

JFETs were irradiated with 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences up to 4×1014 cm-2. Measurement showed that fast neutrons introduce deep levels acting mostly as deep acceptor centers. These centers gradually compensate lightly doped channel and drift regions of JFETs. As a result, characteristics are deteriorated, the JFET threshold voltage gradually increases and transconductance is lowered. At fluences higher than 4×1014 cm-2, the low doped n-regions are fully compensated and transistor loses its functionality. The 2D physical model of JFET in ATLAS simulator was developed and calibrated including the neutron irradiation effects. Simulation showed a good agreement with experimental data. This confirmed that carrier removal in the channel and drift region by acceptors centers introduced by neutrons is a dominant reason of SiC JFET degradation.},

              2D materials have shown great promise for next‐generation high‐performance photodetectors. However, the performance of photodetectors based on 2D materials is generally limited by the tradeoff between photoresponsivity and photodetectivity. Here, a novel junction field‐effect transistor (JFET) photodetector consisting of a PdSe

The high performance is attributed to the modulation of the depletion region by the dual‐gate, which can effectively suppress the dark current and enhance the photocurrent, thereby realizing high detectivity and responsivity. The JFET photodetector provides a new approach to realize photodetectors with high responsivity and detectivity.},

	abstract = {In view of the difficulties in planar CMOS transistor scaling to preserve an acceptable gate to channel control FINFET based multi-gate (MuGFET) devices have been proposed as a technology option for replacing the existing technology. The attractiveness of FINFET consists in the realization of self-aligned double-gate devices with a conventional CMOS process. This allows extending the gate scaling beyond the planar transitor limits, maintaining a steep subthreshold slope, better performance with bias voltage scaling and good matching due to low doping concentration in the channel. There are, however, several challenges and roadblocks that FINFET technology has to face to be competitive with other technology options: high access resistance related to the extremely thin body, Vtau setting, implementation of strain boosters and manufacturability related to the non planar process and very tight process control.},

It is found that statistical distribution of direct tunnel leakage current through 1.2 to 2.8 nm thick gate oxides induces significant fluctuations in the threshold voltage and transconductance when the gate oxide tunnel resistance becomes comparable to gate poly-Si resistance. By calculating the measured tunnel current based on multiple scattering theory, it is shown that the device characteristics fluctuations will be problematic when the gate oxide thickness is scaled down to less than 1 nm.},

However, the downscaling of the gate length becomes the biggest challenge to maintain higher speed, lower power, and better electrostatic integrity for each following generation. Both industry and academia have been studying new device architectures and materials to address this challenge. In preparation for the 12-nm technology node, this paper assesses the performance of the {\textbackslash}hboxIn\_0.75{\textbackslash}hboxGa\_0.25{\textbackslash}hboxAs of III–V semiconductor compounds and strained-Si channel nanoscale transistors with identical dimensions. The impact of the channel material property and the device architecture on the ultimate performance of ballistic transistors is theoretically analyzed. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional real-space ballistic quantum transport models are employed with band structure nonparabolicity. The simulation results indicate three conclusions: 1) the {\textbackslash}hboxIn\_0.75 {\textbackslash}hboxGa\_0.25{\textbackslash}hboxAs FETs do not outperform strained-Si FETs; 2) triple-gate Fin-shaped Field Effect Transistor (FinFET) surely represent the best architecture for sub-15-nm gate contacts, independently from the material choice; and 3) the simulations results further show that the overall device performance is very strongly influenced by the source and drain resistances.},

The vertex detector will be composed of two layers of pixel detectors (DEPFET) and four layers of strip detectors. The DEPFET sensor requires switching and current readout circuits for its operation. These circuits have been designed as ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) in several different versions, but they provide insufficient flexibility for precise detector testing. Therefore, a test system with a flexible control cycle range and minimal noise has been designed for testing and characterizing of small detector prototypes (Minimatrices).

This nonionising electromagnetic radiation is absorbed at molecular level and manifests as changes in vibrational energy of the molecules or heat (Microwaves irradiating the community, Hidden hazards, Bantan Books publisher, Australia, 1991). Identifying and evaluating the biological effects of microwaves have been complex and controversial. Because of the paucity of information on the mechanism of interaction between microwave and biological systems, there has been a persistent view in physical and engineering sciences, that microwave fields are incapable of inducing bioeffects other than by heating (Health Physics 61 (1991) 3). Of late, the nonthermal effects of microwaves on tissue responses are being documented (Physiol. Rev. 61 (1981) 435; Annals of New York Acad. Sci. 247 (1975) 232; J.

The present article is an attempt to familiarise the reader with pertinent information regarding the effects, mainly athermal, of microwave irradiation on biologic systems, especially microorganisms.},

	abstract = {Infrared (IR) radiation is electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths between 760nm and 100,000nm. Low-level light therapy (LLLT) or photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy generally employs light at red and near-infrared wavelengths (600-100nm) to modulate biological activity. Many factors, conditions, and parameters influence the therapeutic effects of IR, including fluence, irradiance, treatment timing and repetition, pulsing, and wavelength. Increasing evidence suggests that IR can carry out photostimulation and photobiomodulation effects particularly benefiting neural stimulation, wound healing, and cancer treatment. Nerve cells respond particularly well to IR, which has been proposed for a range of neurostimulation and neuromodulation applications, and recent progress in neural stimulation and regeneration are discussed in this review. The applications of IR therapy have moved on rapidly in recent years. For example, IR therapy has been developed that does not actually require an external power source, such as IR-emitting materials, and garments that can be powered by body heat alone. Another area of interest is the possible involvement of solar IR radiation in photoaging or photorejuvenation as opposites sides of the coin, and whether sunscreens should protect against solar IR? A better understanding of new developments and biological implications of IR could help us to improve therapeutic effectiveness or develop new methods of PBM using IR wavelengths.},

Further studies of production, absorption and scattering in atomic and nuclear processes are described, including a completely new chapter on X-ray production by protons, alpha-particles and ions. The concluding chapter surveys some more advanced fields of study.

No other physician or scientist had ever imagined such a powerful and worthwhile discovery. Other scientists paved the way for Roentgen to approach the use of these new X-rays for medical purposes. In this way, initially, and prior to Roentgen, Thompson, Hertz, and Lenard applied themselves to the early developments of this technology. They made good advances but never reached the clearly defined understanding brought about by Roentgen. The use of a Crookes tube, a barium platinocyanide screen, with fluorescent light and the generation of energy to propagate the cathode rays were the necessary elements for the conception of an X-ray picture. On November 8, 1895, Roentgen began his experiments on X-ray technology when he found that some kind of rays were being produced by the glass of the tube opposite to the cathode. The development of a photograph successfully completed this early imaging process. After six intense weeks of research, on December 22, he obtained a photograph of the hand of his wife, the first X-ray ever made. This would be a major contribution to the world of medicine and surgery.},

This expansion converges very rapidly and even the octupole transitions may be neglected. In the case of the anomalous absorption of x rays in perfect single crystals (Borrmann effect), the absorption cross sections become angular-dependent. This angular dependence allows in principle a direct experimental determination of the quadrupole term of the atomic photoelectric absorption cross section. Measurements by several authors indicate the existence of the electric quadrupole transitions.},

The main consequences of the illumination by a GRB are grouped into four distinct classes and analysed separately, namely: direct γ flash, UV flash, O3 layer depletion and cosmic rays. The effectiveness of each of these classes is compared and distances for significant biological damage are given for each one. We find that the first three effects have the potential to cause global environmental changes and biospheric damage, even if the source is located at galactic distances or even farther afield (up to 150 kpc, where 1 parsec=3.09×1016 m, about five times the Galactic diameter of 30 kpc). Instead, cosmic rays would only be a serious threat for close sources (of the order of a few parsecs).As a concrete application from a well-recorded event, the effects on the biosphere of an event identical to the giant flare of SGR1806-20 on 27 December 2004 have been calculated. In spite of not belonging to the so-called ‘classical’ GRBs, most of the parameters of this recent flare are quite well known and have been used as a calibration for our study. We find that a giant flare impinging on Earth is not a threat for life in all practical situations, mainly because it is not as energetic, in spite of being much more frequent than GRBs, unless the source happens to be extremely close.},

The chapter discusses the emission induced by electron bombardment called as “secondary electron emission,” discovered during a study of the reflection of electrons from metals. The theory of secondary emission is far from complete. The main reason for this state of affairs is the complexity of the problem, which becomes evident when one considers qualitatively what happens in the secondary emission process. This first step in the process presumably involves the interaction of a beam of incident electrons of energies in the range between 100 ev–10 kev with the solid. This leads to a cascade process of ionization and excitation, combined with elastic and inelastic scattering of the cascade electrons. The second step is concerned with the number of cascade electrons that escape from the surface and with their energy distribution.},

However, instead of utilizing the principle of ionization of the air, the α particles are made to strike the gate of an n-channel mosfet. This results in a net positive charge on the gate of the transistor. The current through the mosfet will be proportional to the charge on the gate and, hence, to the intensity of the α particles. If particles of smoke enter the detector and screen the α particles, the positive charge on the gate drops, which leads to a reduced current or total cut-off of the mosfet.},

	abstract = {Diffusion limitations on the penetration of nanocarriers in solid tumors hamper their therapeutic use when labeled with α-particle emitters. This is mostly due to the α-particles' relatively short range (≤100 μm) resulting in partial tumor irradiation and limited killing. To utilize the high therapeutic potential of α-particles against solid tumors, we designed non-targeted, non-internalizing nanometer-sized tunable carriers (pH-tunable liposomes) that are triggered to release, within the slightly acidic tumor interstitium, highly-diffusive forms of the encapsulated α-particle generator Actinium-225 (225Ac) resulting in more homogeneous distributions of the α-particle emitters, improving uniformity in tumor irradiation and increasing killing efficacies. On large multicellular spheroids (400 μm-in-diameter), used as surrogates of the avascular areas of solid tumors, interstitially-releasing liposomes resulted in best growth control independent of HER2 expression followed in performance by (a) the HER2-targeting radiolabeled antibody or (b) the non-responsive liposomes. In an orthotopic human HER2-negative mouse model, interstitially-releasing 225Ac-loaded liposomes resulted in the longest overall and median survival. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of a general strategy to bypass the diffusion-limited transport of radionuclide carriers in solid tumors enabling interstitial release from non-internalizing nanocarriers of highly-diffusing and deeper tumor-penetrating molecular forms of α-particle emitters, independent of cell-targeting.},

	abstract = {Radiation effects in solid-state microelectronics can be split into two general categories: cumulative effects and single-event effects (SEEs). Cumulative effects produce gradual changes in the operational parameters of the devices, whereas SEEs cause abrupt changes or transient behavior in circuits. The space radiation environment provides a multitude of trapped, solar, and cosmic ray charged particles that cause such effects, interfere with space-system operation, and, in some cases, threaten the survival of such space systems. This article will describe these effects and how their impact may be mitigated in silicon-based microcircuits.},

	abstract = {Space radiation dosimetry presents one of the greatest challenges in the discipline of radiation protection. This is a result of both the highly complex nature of the radiation fields encountered in low-Earth orbit (LEO) and interplanetary space and of the constraints imposed by spaceflight on instrument design. This paper reviews the sources and composition of the space radiation environment in LEO as well as beyond the Earth's magnetosphere. A review of much of the dosimetric data that have been gathered over the last four decades of human space flight is presented. The different factors affecting the radiation exposures of astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are emphasized. Measurements made aboard the Mir Orbital Station have highlighted the importance of both secondary particle production within the structure of spacecraft and the effect of shielding on both crew dose and dose equivalent. Roughly half the dose on ISS is expected to come from trapped protons and half from galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). The dearth of neutron measurements aboard LEO spacecraft and the difficulty inherent in making such measurements have led to large uncertainties in estimates of the neutron contribution to total dose equivalent. Except for a limited number of measurements made aboard the Apollo lunar missions, no crew dosimetry has been conducted beyond the Earth's magnetosphere. At the present time we are forced to rely on model-based estimates of crew dose and dose equivalent when planning for interplanetary missions, such as a mission to Mars. While space crews in LEO are unlikely to exceed the exposure limits recommended by such groups as the NCRP, dose equivalents of the same order as the recommended limits are likely over the course of a human mission to Mars.},

	abstract = {In the mid-1980s, space experiments began to examine if microgravity could alter the biological effects of space radiation. In the late 1990s, repair of DNA strand breaks was reported to not be influenced by microgravity using the pre-irradiated cells, because the exposure doses of space radiation were few due to the short spaceflight. There were, however, conflicting reports depending on the biological endpoints used in various systems. While almost no attempts were made to assess the possibility that the microgravity effects could be altered by space radiation. This was probably due to the general understanding that microgravity plays a major role in space and works independently from space radiation. Recent ground-based simulation studies focusing on DNA oxidative damage and signal transduction suggested that combined effects of microgravity and space radiation might exist. These studies also implicated the importance of research focusing not only on chromosomal DNA but also on cytoplasm, especially mitochondria. Therefore, we propose a new model which accounts for the combined-effects through the window of cellular responses. In this model, the interactions between microgravity and space radiation might occur during the following cellular-responses; (A) damaging and signaling by ROS, (B) damage responses on DNA (repair, replication, transcription, etc.), and (C) expression of gene and protein (regulation by chromatin, epigenetic control, etc.).},

	abstract = {© 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd. Graphene-based micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) are very promising candidates for next generation miniaturized, lightweight, and ultra-sensitive devices. In this review, we review the progress to date of the assessment of the mechanical, electromechanical, and thermomechanical properties of graphene for application in graphene-based MEMS. Graphene possesses a plethora of outstanding properties - such as a 1 TPa Young's modulus, exceptionally high 2D failure strength that stems from its sp2 hybridization, and strong sigma bonding between carbon atoms. Such exceptional mechanical properties can enable, for example, graphene-based sound sources capable of generating sound beyond the audible range. The recently engineered piezoelectric properties of atomic force microscope tip-pressed graphene membranes or supported graphene on SiO2 substrates, have paved the way in fabricating graphene-based nano-generators and actuators. On the other hand, graphene's piezoresistive properties have enabled miniaturized pressure and strain sensors. 2D graphene nano-mechanical resonators can potentially measure ultralow forces, charges and potentially detect single atomic masses. The exceptional tribology of graphene can play a significant role in achieving superlubricity. In addition, the highest reported thermal conductivity of graphene is amenable for use in chips and providing better performing MEMS, as heat is efficiently dissipated. On top of that, graphene membranes could be nano-perforated to realize specialized applications like DNA translocation and desalination. Finally, to ensure stability and reliability of the graphene-based MEMS, adhesion is an important mechanical property that should be considered. In general, graphene could be used as a structural material in resonators, sensors, actuators and nano-generators with better performance and sensitivity than conventional MEMS.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 RNA is identified as a pivotal player to bolster energizing zones of COVID-19 detection. Herein, we develop a rapid and unamplified nanosensing platform for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human throat swab specimens. A gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-decorated graphene field-effect transistor (G-FET) sensor was fabricated, after which complementary phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligos (PMO) probe was immobilized on the AuNP surface. This sensor allowed for highly sensitive testing of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as PMO does not have charges, leading to low background signal. Not only did the method present a low limit of detection in PBS (0.37 fM), throat swab (2.29 fM), and serum (3.99 fM), but also it achieved a rapid response to COVID-19 patients' samples within 2 min. The developed nanosensor was capable of analyzing RNA extracts from 30 real clinical samples. The results show that the sensor could differentiate the healthy people from infected people, which are in high agreement with RT-PCR results (Kappa index = 0.92). Furthermore, a well-defined distinction between SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and SARS-CoV RdRp was also made. Therefore, we believe that this work provides a satisfactory, attractive option for COVID-19 diagnosis.},

          , 
            Recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) graphene assembly have shown how we can make solid porous materials that are lighter than air. It is plausible that these solid materials can be mechanically strong enough for applications under extreme conditions, such as being a substitute for helium in filling up an unpowered flight balloon. However, knowledge of the elastic modulus and strength of the porous graphene assembly as functions of its structure has not been available, preventing evaluation of its feasibility. We combine bottom-up computational modeling with experiments based on 3D-printed models to investigate the mechanics of porous 3D graphene materials, resulting in new designs of carbon materials. Our study reveals that although the 3D graphene assembly has an exceptionally high strength at relatively high density (given the fact that it has a density of 4.6\% that of mild steel and is 10 times as strong as mild steel), its mechanical properties decrease with density much faster than those of polymer foams. Our results provide critical densities below which the 3D graphene assembly starts to lose its mechanical advantage over most polymeric cellular materials.},

Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

	abstract = {As new carbon-based materials, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) many advantages due to the additional unique properties that arise from their nanoscale small size. GQDs are expected to be suitable for various applications. For use of GQDs in various fields, mass production is critically required. To date, many methods for preparing GQDs with good properties and high yield have been introduced. The main synthesis strategies are known as bottom-up and top-down methods. Synthesis of GQDs from small organic molecules, known as the bottom-up approach, is appropriate for controlling the size of GQDs but requires multistep organic reactions and purification at each step. However, the top-down approach of breaking the carbon-carbon bonds of a large carbon source is easy and simple, and therefore suitable for mass production. Here, we briefly introduce the solution-process synthesis of GQDs using a top-down method and recent energy-related applications such as capacitors, lithium ion batteries, and solar cells.},

Its biosafety and potential cytotoxicity to human and animal cells has been a growing concern in recent years. In this work, the potential cytotoxicity of GQDs was evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulation demonstrates that small size GQDs could easily permeate into the lipid membrane in a vertical way. It is relatively difficult to permeate into the lipid membrane for GQDs that are larger than GQD61 on the nanosecond time-scale. The thickness of the POPC membrane could even be affected by the small size of GQDs. Free energy calculations revealed that the free energy barrier of GQD permeation through the lipid membrane could greatly change with the change of GQD size. Under high GQD concentration, the GQD molecules could rapidly aggregate in water but disaggregate after entering into the membrane interior. Moreover, high concentrations of GQDs could induce changes in the structure properties and diffusion properties of the lipid bilayer, and it may affect the cell signal transduction. However, GQDs with relatively small size are not large enough to mechanically damage the lipid membrane. Our results suggest that the cytotoxicity of GQDs with small size is low and may be appropriate for biomedical application.},

The emission exhibits a nonlinear dependence on the laser fluence. In two-pulse correlation measurements, a dominant relaxation time of tens of femtoseconds is observed.

	abstract = {Today, transistors with 20 nanometer (nm) channel length are in mass production and many researchers believe that we are reaching a limit with downsizing conventionally used silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) [1]. To keep up with the trend of making the transistor smaller, new channel materials are studied, and graphene has come into the spotlight. Graphene became a serious contender mostly due to its high mobility, but other properties such as high velocity saturation and the two-dimensional (2D) nature of the material have gained more attention in recent years [2–4]. The first graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) was reported in 2004, since many transistors with graphene as a channel material have been successfully fabricated [3]. It is important to have accurate simulation models that showcase all the peculiar behaviours of GFETs. Even though several new models with high accuracy, have been presented in recent years, few theoretical explanations exist. This thesis work focuses greatly on the theory behind two different simulation models for GFETs. Several parameter approximations are investigated, with focus on the possibility of showcasing negative differential resistance (NDR). In conclusion, we can see that the drift-diffusion (DD) model show good agreement with data and showcases NDR, while the virtual source (VS) model is more unstable and does not give NDR. I hope this thesis can act as a knowledge base, to facilitate for future simulation models. (Less)},

            Graphene is a wonder material with many superlatives to its name. It is the thinnest known material in the universe and the strongest ever measured. Its charge carriers exhibit giant intrinsic mobility, have zero effective mass, and can travel for micrometers without scattering at room temperature. Graphene can sustain current densities six orders of magnitude higher than that of copper, shows record thermal conductivity and stiffness, is impermeable to gases, and reconciles such conflicting qualities as brittleness and ductility. Electron transport in graphene is described by a Dirac-like equation, which allows the investigation of relativistic quantum phenomena in a benchtop experiment. This review analyzes recent trends in graphene research and applications, and attempts to identify future directions in which the field is likely to develop.},

Based on an ultrathin substrate, the biosensor offers a high level of mechanical durability and consistent sensing responses, while conforming to non-planar surfaces such as the human body and withstanding large deformations (e.g., bending and stretching). Moreover, a nonionic surfactant is employed to minimize the nonspecific adsorption of the biosensor, hence enabling cytokine detection (TNF-α and IFN-γ, significant inflammatory cytokines, are used as representatives) in artificial tears (used as a biofluid representative). The experimental results demonstrate that the biosensor very consistently and sensitively detects TNF-α and IFN-γ, with limits of detection down to 2.75 and 2.89 pM, respectively. The biosensor, which undergoes large deformations, can thus potentially provide a consistent and sensitive detection of cytokines in the human body.},

Here we report the first observation of saturating transistor characteristics in a graphene field-effect transistor. The saturation velocity depends on the charge-carrier concentration and we attribute this to scattering by interfacial phonons in the SiO2 layer supporting the graphene channels5,6. Unusual features in the current–voltage characteristic are explained by a field-effect model and diffusive carrier transport in the presence of a singular point in the density of states. The electrostatic modulation of the channel through an efficiently coupled top gate yields transconductances as high as 150 µS µm−1 despite low on–off current ratios. These results demonstrate the feasibility of two-dimensional graphene devices for analogue and radio-frequency circuit applications without the need for bandgap engineering.},

Since most of the GFET models reported in the literature are complex and hard to understand, a model of a GFET was implemented and made available in MATLAB, Verilog in Cadence, and VHDL-AMS in Simplorer—useful tools for circuit designers with different backgrounds. A tutorial is presented, enabling the researchers to easily implement the model to predict the performance of their devices. In short, this paper aims to provide the initial knowledge and tools for researchers willing to use GFETs in their designs at the system level, who are looking to implement an initial setup that allows the inclusion of the performance of GFETs.},

            Functionalization of graphene is essential to interface it with other moieties to expand the scope of its electrical/electronic applications. However, chemical functionalization and/or molecular interactions on graphene sensitively modulate its electrical properties. To evaluate and take advantage of the properties of functionalized graphene, it is important to understand how its electrical attributes (such as carrier scattering, carrier concentration, charge polarity, quantum‐capacitance enhanced doping, energy levels, transport mechanisms, and orbital hybridization of energy‐bands) are influenced by a change in carbon's structural conformation, hybridization state, chemical potential, local energy levels, and dopant/interface coupling induced via functionalization or molecular interactions. Here, a detailed and integrated model describes factors influencing these electrical characteristics of functionalized graphene (covalent bonds, adsorption, π–π bonds, and lattice incorporation). The electrical properties are governed via three mechanisms: (a) conversion of carbon's hybridized state, (b) dipole interactions enhanced via quantum capacitance, and (c) orbital hybridization with an interfacing molecule. A few graphenic materials are also identified where further studies are essential to understand the effect of their functionalization.},

Now, graphene and related two-dimensional (2D) materials offer prospects of unprecedented advances in device performance at the atomic limit, and a synergistic combination of 2D materials with silicon chips promises a heterogeneous platform to deliver massively enhanced potential based on silicon technology. Integration is achieved via three-dimensional monolithic construction of multifunctional high-rise 2D silicon chips, enabling enhanced performance by exploiting the vertical direction and the functional diversification of the silicon platform for applications in opto-electronics and sensing. Here we review the opportunities, progress and challenges of integrating atomically thin materials with silicon-based nanosystems, and also consider the prospects for computational and non-computational applications.},

These unusual properties are due to alteration of the Fermi energy position, density of states, and work function of those heterostructures rather than their chemical components. The physical and quantum properties, the interfacial layer and the synergistic effect of each component in 2D heterostructures lead to the generation of new behavior and properties. In this review article, we are focusing on the recent progress in studying the characteristics and properties of 2D graphene/TMO heterostructures, and their significant applications in advanced energy storage and conversion devices. In this context, we firstly introduce bottom-up wet chemical approaches for the synthesis of 2D graphene/TMO heterostructures. The electron transfer, bonding chemistry and defects at the interface of these heterostructures are then discussed. Thirdly, the tunable properties of 2D graphene/TMO heterostructures and their applications in advanced energy storage and conversion devices are presented. The final section discusses the challenges and future prospects of 2D graphene/TMO heterostructures.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews key elements of the theoretical foundation and numerical implementation of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solutions of Maxwell's equations. FDTD and related space-grid time-domain techniques are direct solution methods for Maxwell's curl equations. These methods employ no potentials; rather they are based on volumetric sampling of the unknown electric and magnetic fields in and surrounding the structure of interest over a period of time. FDTD is one of the most powerful and widely used numerical modeling approaches for electromagnetic wave interaction problems. With expanding developer and user communities in an increasing number of disciplines in science and engineering, FDTD technology is continually evolving in terms of its theoretical basis, numerical implementation, and technological applications, which now span the spectral range from low-frequency (ELF) to daylight. FDTD and related techniques are marching-in-time procedures that simulate the continuous actual electromagnetic waves in a finite spatial region by sampled-data numerical analogs propagating in a computer data space. Time-stepping continues as the numerical wave analogs propagate in the space lattice to causally connect the physics of the modeled region. Predictive dynamic range is also focused in the chapter. For computational modeling of electromagnetic wave interaction structures using FDTD and related space-grid time-domain techniques, it is useful to consider the concept of a predictive dynamic range. © 2005},

For graphene as well, this paper specifically discusses the use of traditional modification methods to improve graphene’s electrical and thermoelectrical properties.

Therefore, this paper reviews the graphene modification field in recent years. Through the change in the shape of graphene, the change in the boundary structure configuration, the doping of other atoms, and the formation of a heterostructure, the electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric properties of graphene change, resulting in broader applications in more fields.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The exclusive monoatomic framework of graphene makes it as an alluring material to be implemented in electronic devices. Thus, using graphene as charge carrying conducting channel material in Field Effect Transistors (FET) expedites the opportunities for production of ultrasensitive biosensors for future device applications. However, performance of GFET is influenced by various parameters, particularly by the length of conducting channel. Therefore, in this study we have investigated channel length scaling in performance of graphene field effect transistor (GFET) via simulation technique using Lumerical DEVICE software. The performance was analyzed based on electrical characterization of GFET with long and short conducting channels. It proves that conducting channel lengths have vast effect on ambipolar curve where short channel induces asymmetry in transfer characteristics curve where the n-branch is suppressed. Whereas for output characteristics, the performance of GFET heavily degraded as the channel length is reduced in short channels of GFET. Therefore, channel length scaling is a vital parameter in determining the performance of GFET in various fields, particularly in biosensing applications for ultrasensitive detection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze the effect of adding graphene layer on the porous silicon waveguide sensor. From rigorous theoretical calculations it is found that the resonant porous silicon sensor shows a 60-fold improvement in sensitivity over conventional SPR technology [1]. This paper proposes a Psi waveguide sensor designed in FDTD Lumerical software[2] with graphene layer. Due to having extraordinary properties, the added graphene layer increases the sensitivity of the sensor. This designed Psi waveguide sensor can be used as DNA detector[1], Optical gas sensor[3], Novel liquid sensor[4], Vapour sensor[5] with better sensitivity.},

We exploit distinct material properties of different substrates to address different application regimes. Radiation detection with GFET is based on the high sensitivity of graphene resistivity on local electric field perturbations caused by ionized charges generated in the radiation absorbing semiconductor substrate. Light, X-rays, and gamma rays have been detected in our experiments.},
